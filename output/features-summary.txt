# FEATURES  Our calculator is equipped with a suite of features tailored to meet the diverse needs of our user base:  - Addition (add): Effortlessly sum two numbers, regardless of magnitude, with our optimized addition function. - Subtraction (subtract): Determine the numerical difference between values with our accurate subtraction routine. - Multiplication (multiply): Utilize our multiplication feature to calculate the product of two figures swiftly. - Division (divide): Divide numbers with confidence, knowing our division method handles zero denominators gracefully. - Power (power): Elevate your calculations with the power function, designed to process exponential operations reliably.  # GETTING STARTED  Embark on your computational journey with the Advanced Python Calculator by following these steps:  1. Confirm the installation of Python on your system. We recommend version 3.6 or above for optimal performance. 2. Clone or download the repository's contents from the master branch. 3. Use the terminal to navigate to the directory that houses the calculator files. 4. Invoke the calculator's interface by executing 'python main.py' in your shell.  # USAGE INSTRUCTIONS  The calculator's operations can be accessed via the command-line interface or through integration into other Python scripts. Here is a detailed guide on utilizing each function:  ## Addition: - Invoke the add function with two numerical arguments to compute their sum.   Syntax Example: 'print(add(5, 3))' yields an output of '8'.  ## Subtraction: - The subtract function accepts two parameters—the minuend and the subtrahend—and returns their difference.   Syntax Example: 'print(subtract(10, 5))' yields an output of '5'.  ## Multiplication: - Employ the multiply function to obtain the product of two provided multiplicands.   Syntax Example: 'print(multiply(4, 5))' yields an output of '20'.  ## Division: - The divide function adeptly divides the dividend by the divisor and elegantly handles any attempts to divide by zero.   Syntax Example: 'print(divide(20, 4))' yields an output of '5.0'.   Syntax Example: 'print(divide(20, 0))' yields an output of 'Cannot divide by zero'.  ## Power: - Use the power function to raise a base number to the exponent of your choice.   Syntax Example: 'print(power(2, 3))' yields an output of '8'.  # DETAILED ERROR HANDLING  Our calculator does not merely perform calculations; it does so with a user-centric approach to error management. Should a division by zero occur, the user is met with a clear message, not a system exception. This philosophy of user-friendly error messages is woven throughout the application to ensure a seamless computational experience.  # CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROJECT  The Advanced Python Calculator thrives on community involvement.
